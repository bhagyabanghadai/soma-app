Got it 👍 — so you don’t want to add brand-new advanced modules, but instead **polish and improve the features Soma already has**. Here’s where I see opportunities for refinement:

---

## 🌱 Main Dashboard (/dashboard)

* **Better Data Visualization** → Use more intuitive chart types (heatmaps, gauges, or donut charts) for AQI, NDVI, and soil metrics.
* **Customizable Widgets** → Let farmers choose which metrics/cards show up first.
* **Alert System UI** → Use icons + sound/vibration for critical alerts (frost, drought).

---

## 🌾 Soil Health Monitoring (/soil-health)

* **Clearer Scoring System** → Add a simple “Green = Healthy, Yellow = Moderate, Red = Critical” display.
* **Comparison View** → Show today’s soil test vs last test side by side.
* **Action Guidance** → Recommendations should include *cost estimate + time to see improvement*.

---

## 💧 Water Usage Analytics (/water-usage)

* **Unit Conversion** → Allow switching between liters, gallons, acre-feet (region-specific).
* **Budget Overlay** → Water cost charts should include monthly budget line.
* **AI Schedules Export** → Let farmers download irrigation schedules as PDF/CSV for field workers.

---

## 🌿 Regenerative Practices (/practices)

* **Practice Templates** → Pre-filled plans (e.g., “Cover Crops for Cornfield”) to save farmer setup time.
* **Impact Icons** → Visual badges (💧 for water saved, 🌍 for carbon reduced, 🌱 for soil health).
* **Simpler Progress Tracker** → A clear percentage bar per practice (“45% complete”).

---

## 💰 Carbon Credit Tracking (/carbon-credits)

* **Market Updates** → Show current average carbon credit price (not advanced trading, just reference).
* **Practice Highlight** → Call out which practice contributes most to credits.
* **Projection Graphs** → Simple bar chart: Year 1 vs Year 3 vs Year 5.

---

## 📊 Sustainability Reports (/reports)

* **Cleaner Layout** → Group soil, water, and carbon in sections so reports don’t feel cluttered.
* **Quick Export Buttons** → One-click “Export PDF” in addition to JSON.
* **AI Summary Paragraph** → Short human-readable summary at the top (“Your farm improved NDVI by 7% over last 90 days”).

---

## 🤖 Global AI Assistant

* **Pre-built FAQ Buttons** → Common quick actions like “Check water schedule” or “View soil score.”
* **Confidence Simplification** → Instead of raw % (like 78%), show icons (✅ High, ⚠️ Medium, ❓ Low).
* **Save Conversations** → Let farmers bookmark useful AI answers for later.

---

## 🔄 Real-time Collaboration

* **Activity Filter** → Let users filter feed by task type (water, soil, alerts).
* **Offline Notes** → If no internet, allow note entry and sync later.
* **Task Reminders** → Simple date/time reminders for collaborative tasks.

---

## 📱 General Improvements

* **Landing Page Before Login** → A clean homepage with explanation + demo screenshots.
* **Consistent Icons/Colors** → Right now some parts look plain — unify design with green/earthy theme.
* **Mobile-first Enhancements** → Bigger buttons, offline caching for rural areas.

✅ These refinements don’t add “new” big features — they just make the **existing features easier, clearer, and more useful for farmers day-to-day**.

Do you want me to draft a **before/after UI mockup suggestion** (like how the dashboard and soil page would look improved), or keep it as a written improvement checklist?
