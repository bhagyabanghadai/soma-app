I want to integrate the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API into my React-based web application called SOMA. This is a real-time, visually appealing API that fetches a new space-related image or video each day.

Here are detailed instructions on how to implement it:

🌌 Purpose of the NASA API in this App:
The purpose of using the NASA API is to bring daily inspiration and science-backed space content to the users of SOMA.

It should feel like a “Featured Insight of the Day” section, where users can see an image or video, along with a title and explanation.

📄 Page Name:
Create or update a page/component named: NasaMedia.js and route: /nasa-media

🧩 Functionality Instructions:
API Key:

Use the NASA APOD endpoint:
https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY

Replace DEMO_KEY with an environment variable:
REACT_APP_NASA_API_KEY

Frontend Tech Stack:

ReactJS functional component

axios or fetch to make API call

useEffect and useState hooks

Show a loading spinner until the data is fetched

What to Display (UI content):

If the media is an image:

Large centered image

If the media is a video (like a YouTube embed):

Use <iframe> to display it responsively

Below the image/video:

Title (bold, large)

Explanation (paragraph)

Date of publication

A button/link to view directly on NASA’s website

Styling:

Dark theme, minimal glow

Card-style container

Fully responsive layout

Use Tailwind CSS or clean modular CSS (your choice)

Bonus Features (Optional but useful):

Add a “Save as Favorite” button (just UI for now, no backend needed yet)

Add tooltip/info icon explaining: “This data comes directly from NASA’s public science feed”

🗂 Where this section should be linked:
Add a "NASA Media" link in the navbar/sidebar.

Route it to: /nasa-media

🔐 .env Setup:
Tell me if .env is already created, or else create a .env file and add:

ini
Copy
Edit
REACT_APP_NASA_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
And don’t forget to restart the dev server after saving .env.
