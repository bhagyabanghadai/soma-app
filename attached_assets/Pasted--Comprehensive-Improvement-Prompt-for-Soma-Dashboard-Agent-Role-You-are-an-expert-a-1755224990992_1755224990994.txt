   - *Requirements:*  
     - Map all temperature units to Celsius with °F toggle  
     - Standardize timezones to UTC with local conversion  
     - Validate ranges (e.g., reject NDVI > 1.0 or LST < -50°C)  
     - Flag inconsistencies between sources (e.g., NASA vs NWS temp > 5°C difference)  

2. **Intelligent Caching**  
   - *Task:* Implement location-based caching with expiration logic  
   - *Rules:*  
     - Cache weather data for 15 mins, air quality for 30 mins, NASA data for 4 hours  
     - Show "stale data" badges when offline  
     - Purge cache on location change  

3. **Cross-Source Correlation**  
   - *Task:* Develop anomaly detection algorithms  
   - *Examples:*  
     - Alert if high NDVI coincides with low air quality  
     - Correlate evapotranspiration spikes with wind patterns  

#### **B. AI Intelligence Upgrades**  
1. **Context Enrichment**  
   - *Task:* Enhance location context with:  
     - Elevation data (USGS API)  
     - Soil type classification (NRCS Soil Survey)  
     - Microclimate indicators (proximity to water bodies)  
   - *Implementation:* Append to existing location object  

2. **Personalization Engine**  
   - *Task:* Create lightweight user profiles storing:  
     - Primary crop types (e.g., corn, almonds)  
     - Farm size (acres/hectares)  
     - Equipment ownership (irrigation systems, tractors)  
   - *Usage:* Modify AI prompts to include:  
     ```  
     "User grows {crop} on {size} acres with {equipment}. Prioritize advice relevant to these constraints."  
     ```  

3. **Confidence Scoring**  
   - *Task:* Add reliability metrics to AI responses  
   - *Logic:*  
     - Score 1-5 based on:  
       - Data freshness (real-time = 5, cached = 3)  
       - Source consistency (all APIs agree = 5, conflicting = 2)  
       - Location precision (GPS = 5, manual entry = 3)  
     - Display as: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5) confidence  

#### **C. Location Management Advancements**  
1. **Geofencing**  
   - *Task:* Add field boundary mapping  
   - *Implementation:*  
     - Integrate Leaflet.js for polygon drawing  
     - Store boundaries as GeoJSON in user profiles  
     - Trigger alerts when weather/air quality crosses field boundaries  

2. **Location Intelligence**  
   - *Task:* Build "location memory" system  
   - *Features:*  
     - Auto-save last 5 visited coordinates  
     - Show historical trends for saved locations (e.g., "NDVI down 12% since June")  
     - Compare current conditions to 30-day averages  

#### **D. UX & Technical Refinements**  
1. **Data Visualization**  
   - *Task:* Add interactive charts using Chart.js or D3.js  
   - *Components:*  
     - Temperature/NDVI time-series with zoom  
     - Air quality gauge with WHO thresholds

2. **Offline Resilience**  
   - *Task:* Implement service worker + IndexedDB  
   - *Behavior:*  
     - Cache critical data (last weather update, AI responses)  
     - Show "Offline Mode" banner with last sync time  
     - Queue API calls when connection restored  

3. **Performance Optimization**  
   - *Task:* Reduce API latency  
   - *Actions:*  
     - Add request batching (e.g., single call for weather + air quality)  
     - Implement API response compression (gzip)  
     - Set 8-second timeout per API with circuit breaker pattern  

#### **E. Agricultural Focus Area Enhancements**

     "Recommend drip irrigation installation:  
      - Cost: $1,200/acre  
      - Water savings: 30%  
      - ROI: 2.3 years  
      - Confidence: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆"
