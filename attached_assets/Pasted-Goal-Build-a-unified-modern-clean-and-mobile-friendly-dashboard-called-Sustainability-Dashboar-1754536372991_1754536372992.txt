Goal:
Build a unified, modern, clean, and mobile-friendly dashboard called "Sustainability Dashboard" for a smart agriculture app. The page should replace multiple scattered feature pages with one intelligent layout.

🚜 Target User: Farmers and Agri-specialists
🎯 Purpose: To give real-time environmental insights on air, soil, water, and climate in a single glance.

🌿 Page: `/dashboard` or set it as default home

⚙️ UI Layout (2-column grid on large screens; single-column on mobile):
--------------------------------------------------------------------
| 🌍 Environmental Summary         | 🧠 AI Assistant (Chat box)    |
| 🌿 Vegetation Index (NDVI)       | 📊 Air Quality Index          |
| 🌡️ Surface Temperature           | 🌧️ Weather Forecast (3-day)   |
| 💧 Evapotranspiration & Drought  | 💡 Smart Suggestions (AI-generated text) |
| 📍 Location Picker (Lat/Lon or dropdown)                            |

✔️ Features and Design Details:

1. 🗺️ **Farm Location Input**  
   - Input method: "Use my location", or enter coordinates manually  
   - Show detected location in heading  
   - Geolocation API support

2. 🌍 **Vegetation Index (NDVI)**  
   - Show real value (e.g., 0.48) with a tag (Low/Moderate/High)  
   - Include color-coded status (red/yellow/green)

3. 🌡️ **Surface Temperature**  
   - Large temperature in °C or °F  
   - Add tooltip: “Impacts water need and plant growth”

4. 💧 **Evapotranspiration & Drought Risk**  
   - Show in mm/day  
   - Add drought warning badge if high

5. 🌫️ **Air Quality Index (AQI)**  
   - Value + Health level (e.g., Good, Moderate, Unhealthy)  
   - Suggest mitigation if AQI is poor

6. 🌦️ **Weather Forecast**  
   - Display 3-day forecast with icons (temperature, rainfall, etc.)

7. 🧠 **AI Assistant Panel**  
   - Floating button opens chat card  
   - Placeholder for POST /api/ai/chat  
   - Shows: "How can I improve soil health today?" or “What’s my water risk?”

8. 🧠 **AI Suggestions Card**  
   - Static or dynamic text:  
     “Based on temperature and AQI, consider irrigating early morning.”  
     “Your NDVI suggests poor vegetation. Add organic fertilizer.”

9. 📈 **Visuals**  
   - Use mini charts or gauges where needed  
   - Use icons for each metric (Leaf, Thermometer, Drop, Wind)

10. 📱 **Responsive Design**  
   - 1-column view on mobile  
   - Tabs/collapsible sections for small screens

Color Theme:  
- Background: White or light gray  
- Primary: Forest Green (#228B22)  
- Accent: Soft Yellow / Earthy Orange / Sky Blue  
- Font: Clean, readable (e.g., Inter or Open Sans)

🏁 Deliverables:  
- Working React component for `/dashboard`  
- Uses mock data for now (API placeholders in JSON or functions)  
- Include all visual sections described  
- Tailwind used for styling  

Do NOT create separate pages like `/air-quality`, `/weather`, etc.  
All features must appear in ONE page with smart layout.
